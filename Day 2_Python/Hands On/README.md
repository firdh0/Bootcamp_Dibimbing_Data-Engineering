# 📦 DAY 2 - HANDS ON

## 🚀 Project Overview

This folder contains hands-on exercises for Day 2 of the Bootcamp Dibimbing Data Engineering program. The exercises focus on basic programming concepts in Python, including object-oriented programming (OOP), multithreading, multiprocessing, and efficient coding techniques.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
.
├── 🧪 Hands on Basic Programming in Python.ipynb  # 📊 Jupyter Notebook for hands-on exercises
├── README.md                                      # 📘 Project documentation (this file)
```

## ✨ Features

* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Learn and implement concepts like attributes, methods, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
* **Multithreading and Multiprocessing**: Explore parallel programming techniques to improve performance.
* **Efficient Coding Techniques**: Practice using Python features like list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, lambda functions, and more.

## ✅ Prerequisites

* 🐍 Python 3.x
* 📓 Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Open the `🧪 Hands on Basic Programming in Python.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to complete the exercises.
3. Experiment with the code and modify it to deepen your understanding of the concepts.

## 🗒️ Notes

* Ensure that you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed to run the notebook.
* Customize the exercises as needed to fit your learning objectives.
